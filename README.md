# AI Coding Challenge: Build Your Own Pokédex!

## Welcome to the AI Coding Challenge!
We're diving into the world of Pokémon, challenging you to build your own Pokédex using the PokéAPI. This challenge is designed to test and improve your skills in working with APIs, front-end development, and creative problem-solving.

### Overall Challenge Objectives:
- Develop a web application (Pokédex) that is responsive and user-friendly.
- Utilize the PokéAPI to fetch and display Pokémon data.
- Implement features progressively over four stages to enhance your Pokédex.

## Stages of the Challenge

### Stage 1: Getting Started with PokéAPI
**Objective:** Fetch and display a list of Pokémon.
**Instructions:**
1. Set up a basic web application framework of your choice (React, Vue, Angular, or even vanilla JavaScript).
2. Use the PokéAPI to fetch a list of Pokémon names.
3. Display the list of Pokémon names on your webpage.
**Objectives for Stage 1:**
- Understand how to make API calls and handle responses.
- Display fetched data in a simple, readable format.

### Stage 2: Displaying Pokémon Details
**Objective:** Enhance your Pokédex to show detailed information about each Pokémon.
**Instructions:**
1. Implement a feature that allows users to click on a Pokémon name and view more detailed information about it, such as its abilities, types, and an image.
2. Use the PokéAPI to fetch and display this detailed information.
**Objectives for Stage 2:**
- Deepen API interaction by fetching and displaying detailed information.
- Improve UI/UX design to accommodate additional Pokémon data.

### Stage 3: Advanced Features
**Objective:** Add search functionality and ensure the design is responsive.
**Instructions:**
1. Add a search bar that allows users to find Pokémon by name.
2. Ensure that your Pokédex is responsive and provides a good user experience on different devices.
**Objectives for Stage 3:**
- Implement client-side search functionality.
- Practice responsive web design principles to enhance usability across devices.

### Stage 4: Deployment and Beyond
**Objective:** Incorporate additional features like comparison and deploy your Pokédex.
**Instructions:**
1. Add an advanced feature, such as comparing stats between two Pokémon.
2. Deploy your application to a hosting platform (e.g., GitHub Pages, Vercel, Netlify).
**Objectives for Stage 4:**
- Explore advanced functionality and how it can be integrated.
- Learn about deployment processes and make your project accessible online.

## Submission Guidelines
- Fork this repository to begin your project.
- For each stage, create a branch named `[YourGitHubUsername]-stage-[number]` to work on that stage's features.
- After completing each stage, submit a pull request to the original repository with your changes.
- Ensure your pull request includes a brief summary of the work done, challenges faced, and any features you added.
- After all stages are completed, merge your final stage branch into your main fork and submit a final pull request to indicate completion.

## Resources and Tips
- **PokéAPI Documentation:** Make extensive use of [PokéAPI documentation](https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2) to understand how to fetch the data you need.
- **Front-End Libraries:** While libraries like React or Vue can be helpful, focusing on the fundamentals (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) is also valuable.
- **Responsive Design:** Use CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or TailwindCSS for responsive design, or practice writing your media queries.

## Evaluation Criteria
- **Functionality:** Does the application work as intended at each stage?
- **Creativity:** How creatively are the features implemented?
- **Code Quality:** Is the code well-structured, clean, and commented?
- **UI/UX:** How intuitive, responsive, and visually appealing is the application?
